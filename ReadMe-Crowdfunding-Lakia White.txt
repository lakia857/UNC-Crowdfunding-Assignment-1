This Crowdfunding Analysis shows that the most successful platforms peeked during the summer months between May and August. On the other hand, failed initiatives saw an adverse effect during the same time and cancelled initiatives remained fairly flat throughout the year.

The mean best summarizes successful initiatives had a 30% better chance of success and showed less of a variance.

The data set provided has plenty of valuable data, however the data could have been utilized to better describe a more accurate picture. For example, we could analyze more on how project time constraints could affect the various categories/ sub-categories. This could help to determine whether campaigns are running long enough or if extending time frames may lead to increased funding. Another question could be â€“ what were the methods used for successful vs failed campaigns? Knowing the various marketing methods used could help to shed light on funder response, and therefore possibly increasing funding dollars.
